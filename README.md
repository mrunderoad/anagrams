## Description

This is a Ruby independent project for Epicodus. 


### Running Scripts

Running scripts is optional at Epicodus. However, if you want to experiment with it, follow these steps:

* The script must be located in `lib` and be called `script.rb`.

* Run the following command: `docker-compose run --rm app ruby lib/script.rb`.

Once again, we recommend aliasing this command if you plan to run scripts often. If you prefer to name your script something else, you just need to update the command to use the correct path and file name.
